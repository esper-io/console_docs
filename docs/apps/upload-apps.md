### APK file upload conditions

All application APK files must adhere to certain conditions to succeed in uploading and onboarding:

-   The APK must have a unique version name and number.
-   The APK cannot be larger than 500 MB.
-   The APK file itself must have the .apk extension.
-   The APK file must include signature verification.
-   The application cannot set itself as the default launcher; this will cause conflict with the Esper Agent.
-   The application must adhere to the latest Android APK standards (currently we allow APKs without icons).
    

If you attempt to upload an APK file that has a V2 or V3 signature, but not a V1 signature, it will be rejected. Older Android platforms—those running Marshmallow (6.0) and earlier—require v1 signatures.
