## What is the App Section of the Esper Console?

  

This section enables you to manage the applications used on the Android devices. The devices you manage will be able to install and use those applications you authorize.

There are two different types of Applications you can authorize on your Android devices:

-   Enterprise Applications (APK files)- You can upload Android Packages (APKs) for Enterprise applications to the Esper Cloud (APK is the package file format used by the Android operating system for distribution and installation of mobile appliactions).
-   Google Play Applications- You can authorize—or unauthorize— applications from your managed Google Play store.
    

:::tip
You may approve in-ROM applications or preloaded applications in a device from a Provisioning Template during provisioning by entering the package name in the applications screen. You can find information about the package name ([here](../devices-groups/group-apps.md)).
