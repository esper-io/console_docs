## How to Onboard a Device?

You can use any Android device that meets Esper’s [requirements](../requirements/README.md) as a target device for your applications and can onboard using the Esper Console. Once onboarded and assigned a group, you’ll be able to communicate with your device and deploy and test applications on it. During the process of onboarding, an Esper Device Agent will be installed on the device. Please see  [Onboarding your device](../provisioning-methods/README.md) and follow the method best suited to your device and workflow.

If you are an Android developer and wish to use an AVD (Android Virtual Device), you can quickly provision your AVD using the Esper Device Provisioner tool. Install the Device Provisioner on your development PC, create an AVD in Android Studio, and then run the Device Provisioner to provide the AVD. Find out more [here](https://docs.esper.io/home/provisioner.html#provisioning-an-avd).

You can also create a cloud-based device called a Simulare—this is only available on brand new Esper endpoints. It gives you limited capabilities, but it is an option if you have nothing else to try. We recommend using an actual device or an Android Studio AVD.

:::tip
Once you onboard your first Android device or AVD, the option to create a Simulare device is removed.
