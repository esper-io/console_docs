## How to Sign Up for a Trial Account?

To try out Esper, sign up for a developer trial account on the [Esper Website](https://esper.io/signup/). Once the account set up is complete, you can generate your API key. You can test out all the features of our innovative platform—whether building out a kiosk, point of sale solution, or for an entirely new Dedicated Device category. It is the best platform designed for the Android application developer targeting Dedicated Devices. 

### Set Up an Account

Your first step is to [sign up for a free trial account](https://esper.io/signup). During the signup process, you will be asked to enter a few quick details to set up your environment:

Once you click **Get Started For Free**, you'll automatically log in to your new environment’s Console. You’ll also get an email with your temporary login credentials, along with the URL of your Console. (It will be something like foooo.esper.cloud, where “foooo” is the randomly generated five-letter name of your environment).
