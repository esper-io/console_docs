You can preload preferred Wi-Fi networks to which the provisioned device will automatically connect as they become available. The device will automatically connect to the given Wi-Fi access points as per the availability and network strength after provisioning.

The Wi-Fi on/off and WiFi access points features are not available for devices running Android 10.0 and above.

When you are adding a new access point, you have four fields to configure: Wi-Fi SSID, Wi-Fi Password, Wi-Fi Security type, Hidden. The Wi-Fi SSID and Wi-Fi Password fields are text fields for the SSID and password. Select the security type from the dropdown menu. There are four possible choices:

-   NONE
    
-   WPA- Wireless Protected Access
    
-   WEP- Wired Equivalent Privacy
    
-   EAP- Extensible Authentication Protocol
    

None: None is a open type network. Requirement: SSID

WEP: WEP is a open type network with password. Requirements: SSID, Password (limit: 13 characters)

WPA :Android refers to WPA as WPA/WPA2 but technically WPA and WPA2 are little different from each other. WPA is an enhanced version of WEP. ß Requirements: SSID,Password (limit: 63 characters) EAP: Internally EAP is known as WPA/WPA2/WPA3-Enterprise.

In Android 10 and above, when a WiFi access point is added directly from the device, it is recommended that GPS is ON so that the Wi-Fi access point can reflect back on the Console.

  

On devices running Android 8 or above, sometimes the Wi-Fi access point is displayed as "unknown SSID" even when the device is connected to wifi. You can perform the following steps to resolve this issue:

1.  Switch "ON" the GPS.
    
2.  Refresh the web dashboard after 2-3 minutes.
    
3.  Check if the expected access point is shown.
    

If the access point is still not displayed, try the following steps:

1.  Restart the device.
    
2.  Refresh the web dashboard after 2-3 minutes.
    
3.  Check if the expected access point is shown.
