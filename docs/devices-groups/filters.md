## How to Apply Filters to View Selected Devices?

The filters on the ‘Device & Groups’ section allows you to search devices faster. 

 Once you select the filter parameters, click **Apply** to update the view. Custom filters are stored locally via browser caching. Your selected preferences will be applied automatically when you return to this page unless you update your preferences or clear your cache. You can return to the unfiltered view by clicking **Reset**.
