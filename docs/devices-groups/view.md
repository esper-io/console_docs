# What Are the Different Device Views?

The Directory allows you to manage the nested architecture and oversee your fleet status using a variety of views. You can freely move between views by selecting it from the top right side of their screen. Each view provides different benefits depending on your use case. The two grid views offer a compact, high-level view of your entire fleet, broken down by Parent-level Groups. The two List views provide a more detailed view of your Parent Groups and nested Subgroups. List views also allow you to fire commands to Groups or individual devices without having to separately navigate to each device.

Once a list or grid view is selected, that view will be used for their continued navigation until you select a different view. For example, if you click on a Parent Group from the Directory-level grid view, you will be taken to that parent group grid view. When the group contains no subgroups, you will always be taken to the List: Devices view.

## Directory-level Views:

All the views at the Directory-level display a summary— the last onboarded device, the number of unmanaged devices, and alerts if any— at the top of the page. The ‘Show More’ link will display the 3 most recent devices in each category with a link to view more.

You can scan the QR code to onboard devices directly to the Directory. However, onboarding to Groups is an efficient way to begin provisioning devices automatically when the Group has a Blueprint applied. If you scan the QR code for the directory, that device will not be associated with any group and you cannot automate device management until a device is moved into a group. You can also add a group. Following are the view available at the Directory level:

  

-   Grid- This is the default view, providing an overview of the fleet at the Parent Group level. You will see the parent groups as tiles.

Each Parent Group tile provides an overview of the devices and subgroups within it, and provides quick shortcuts to onboard new devices, add, view, or edit the group’s Blueprint.

-   Grid: Condensed- This compact grid view displays the same Parent Group-level information but with more groups visible on screen at a time.

-   List: Groups- This view displays a list of all the groups, including nested subgroups. It gives you specific details about the devices and allows more actions to be performed.

-   List: Devices- This detailed view lists devices individually, highlighting their onboarding and online status, as well as organizational information, like group name and tags. Clicking Device Id will take you to the device details screen.

## Parent Group Views:

Each view at the Parent-level displays the summary of the number of devices, the subgroups, and alerts if any. It also displays the description if added while creating the group. You can scan the QR code to onboard a device to this Parent Group. You can also add a sub-group. Following are the different Parent Group views:

  

-   Grid- This is the default view, giving you an idea of the fleet breakdown. You will see the parent groups as tiles. The number of sub-groups, total count of devices, and the Blueprint will be displayed for each parent group.

For each of the tiles of the sub-group, you can click the QR code symbol and scan it.

-   List: subgroups- This view lists all the sub-groups of this parent group. It allows you to perform more actions on the devices. If the parent group does not have any sub-groups, you will be directed to the list: device view.

-   List: Devices- This view is the same as the Directory level. It lists all the devices in this parent group.
    

## Subgroup views:

For all the Subgroup views, the summary at the top of the screen displays the device count, any additional nested subgroups, the group’s Blueprint status, Alerts, and Devices in Drift. The expanded summary view will show a detailed hierarchy of the nested group structure to illustrate the inheritance of Blueprint configurations from higher-level groups. Following are the different Subgroup views:

-   Grid- This is the default view. It shows the subgroups present under this group.
    

Note: You can have up to 5 levels of nested subgroups, and infinite groups at each level. ![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/0wvnWwRS8_l9SUF2GDgO10hLtQrW3hrYiE4NHNlTo8c60d445M-V0d9MUXJjM25TIV8ZG71QURbVqYYbKxN0aFkS9lk8MdetFjSFAhHmVd0DMmeecKkhY0v63drHm5epzyLbpftr)

  
  

-   List: subgroups- This detailed view provides an overview of any nested subgroups.
