# What is the Directory Management Device Group in the Directory View?

All the devices that do not have a group assigned to them will be placed in the Unmanaged Devices Group. To edit and manage the device settings, the devices need to be a part of a group.

<!-- ## Pending Approval

This tab displays a list of devices that are pending onboarding approval.

If you begin the onboarding process without creating a record in advance, your device will be listed under the ‘Pending Approval’ tab.

In this situation, the device will begin the setup process and then wait for permission before proceeding.

Once approved the device will finish the Onboarding process. If rejected the device will cancel Onboarding and will require a factory reset.

  

For security reasons, we recommend you approve all the devices to onboard. But if you want to skip this process, turn OFF the Enhanced Onboarding Security under the Esper Settings on the Console. (On the Console, navigate to  **User Management**> **Company Settings**> **Enhanced Onboarding Security**).

In this case, you do not have to upload the serial numbers in advance.

:::tip
The Enhanced Onboarding Security setting will be ON by default.

## Ready to Onboard

This tab displays a list of devices that are ready for onboarding.

You can create a record to automate onboarding approval by uploading a device's unique identifier. You can then select a group, adding optional fields- such as the alias and tags.

These are all the pre-approved devices, and you can onboard the devices whenever you are ready using one of the onboarding methods.

## Assign to Group

If you Onboard a device directly to the Directory level, the device will be placed in the ‘Assign to Group’ tab with default settings.  
These devices have been onboarded and should be moved out of the Directory level into a Group. Organizing into Groups will make it easier to manage your fleet, allowing you to automate device content and configurations using Blueprints.

## Rejected Records
