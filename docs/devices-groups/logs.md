Step 3: The Download status is a live link. Clicking on Download will download the bug report with the date and timestamp for the device to help your technical staff debug any issues.

When you request a capture log from a specific device, a notification will pop up on that device asking permission to share the report. The device user need to swipe down the notification bar, tap the bug report line, and click **Share**. If the device user clicks **Decline**, the report will not be shared and the status will change to Permission Denied by User.
