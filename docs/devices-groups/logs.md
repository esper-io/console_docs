# How to Capture Logs on the Device?

The ‘Request Bug Report’ button allows you to capture and upload a bug report from your device.

Once a bug report has been requested the user will need to manually approve this request. Approval requires the device to be in multi-app mode with the notification bar enabled. This can be accomplished by enabling “Debugging Mode”.

You can then pull down the notification bar to track the progress of the bug report request. ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/HV6Thz92ClPxo-LcNXz0Sha1F5mQKsc_3q73QmM6_pvPITB1c4Yap8HxakEujCeY64pS1qIEeHrPU6JjEzWfKwbEN06G7u1xzdoGWUNNCT8EAlauEEQ4DWRJyypQE1M0A0V36wn_)

For EEA devices, the report will be generated automatically without requiring user consent.

By default Debugging Mode will enable the Notification Bar and place the device into Kiosk mode. The user can also select the gear icon to modify the Debug Mode configurations to include enabling ADB. When Debugging Mode is disabled the device will return to the configuration defined in its Blueprint.
