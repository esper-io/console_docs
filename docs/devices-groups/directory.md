## What is a Directory?

The Directory is a common location for all Devices and Groups. It is a root level that supports nesting. Parent groups are the first level of groups that are created within the Directory. This is where the devices can be associated with a blueprint and manipulated remotely. Subgroups can be created inside Parent Groups.
 Groups can nest up to 5 levels deep and can host an unlimited number of devices at each level.
Ex:

	Parent Group

			Subgroup Level 1

				Subgroup Level 2

					Subgroup Level 3

						Subgroup Level 4

							Subgroup Level 5
