## How to Create a New Policy?

  

To create a new compliance policy, click **New Policy**. Here you can create a new policy. The layout is the same as when you [define a Compliance Policy in a Provisioning Template](../provisioning-template/createtemplate.md),  but uniquely includes the name and description.

  

![New policy button](./images/createpolicy/1-newPolicybutton.png)

  

### Enter a Policy Name and Description

Enter a unique name for the new compliance policy in the Policy Name field; enter an optional description in the Description field.

![Policy name](./images/createpolicy/2-namePolicy.png)

 :::tip
You need a supervisor plugin if your application needs to access some Secure and Global settings. Learn more about this plugin [here](../miscellaneous/supervisor.md).

### Set Lock Screen Password via Policy

  

The Lock Screen Password specifies the conditions for the device unlock password; the default is None.

![Chosoe password](./images/createpolicy/3-password.png)

If you choose alphabetic or alphanumeric, you must set a password length of at least 4 characters and up to 25. Use the up/down arrows to set the required password length.

![Pasword restrictions](./images/createpolicy/4-lengthPassowrd.png)

-   Alphabetic: Restricts acceptable password to only upper and lowercase alphabetic characters (A to Z, and a to z).
-   Alphanumeric: Expands acceptable passwords to include numbers, and special characters in addition to alphabetic characters.
    

:::tip
There is no password required to unlock the device.
:::

The user will set up the password for a device during the initial setup.

The lock screen must be On in order to set Lock Screen Password rules. If you select either Alphabetic or Alphanumeric password rules, then the lock screen will be set to On by Esper if it is currently Off.

 :::tip
When the Compliance policy is applied with password type "None", but a password is already set by the user on device, then the device will get priority. You can remove the password from the device remotely using our API. Contact [Esper team](https://support.esper.io) for more information.
::: 

### Set Default App Permission Rules via Policy

  

Default application permissions determine enforcement of the runtime-rules across all the apps on a device including Enterprise applications installed by Esper, in-ROM applications that are enabled, as well as applications installed via Managed Google Play. This ensures you can control the user experience on the device regarding how run-time permissions are granted.

![App permissions](./images/createpolicy/5-AppPermission.png)

There are three possible settings:

-   Allow Automatically: This rule will grant all the permissions for any application requests without showing a prompt to the user. Allow automatically is the typical setting used for single-purpose solutions using a fully trusted, customer-supplied application.
-   Ask User: This keeps the default behavior intact with regards to permission management. All applications on the device will show a prompt to the user to request permission. For example, each time before accessing a device module, all applications will prompt the user with a message such as “Allow application X to access Gallery? Allow/Deny. Ask user option might not be ideal in some solutions, especially Kiosk-based applications. It can help certain unusual situations dealing with App permissions— contact us directly to find out more.
-   Deny Automatically: This rule will deny any permission request from any application on the device. The Console will not notify the user. You can [grant permissions to applications individually](../apps/control.md) from the Esper Console.
    

### Set System Update Rules via Policy

  

The System updates option allows you to enforce a system update policy on the device when a system update is available via the device’s over-the-air (OTA) update service.

![System updates](./images/createpolicy/6-updaterules.png)

There are four possible settings:

-   Update Automatically: This option will install any over-the-air (OTA) updates automatically as soon as they become available without user interaction, and reboots the devices when necessary.
-   Postpone Installation: This option postpones installation of an OTA update for 30 days. After 30 days, the system will prompt the device user to install the update. Subsequent updates will also follow the same 30-day postponement. This is ideal when you need time to validate your solution against new system updates before they are installed.
-   Windowed Installation: This option allows you to define a window of time during which the OTA update will be installed without user interaction. This option is ideal for devices with a known down period. A drop-down will appear to enable you to set the start and end times for the maintenance window.    
-   Disable Update: This option allows you to disable updates on the device. It is available for a limited set of OTA services that support this feature. If the device does not support disabling updates, it will default to Postpone Installation. Before setting this option please contact Esper to make sure the devices you plan to provision support this configuration.
    

### Configure Esper Settings Application via Policy

Esper offers a custom settings application that gives device users access to a subset of the available Android settings. The Esper settings application is intended for use by technicians servicing a device locally.

![Esper Setting App](./images/createpolicy/7-espersettings.png)

Esper setting application has two modes:

1.  User Mode
    
2.  Admin Mode
    

![Modes](./images/createpolicy/8-typeofuser.png)

This application offers the following settings:

-   Wi-Fi: Change the Wi-Fi access point used by the device. In Android 10 devices and above, it is recommended to enable GPS to view the network information on the device’s Wi-Fi screen. In the devices below Android 10, enabled GPS is needed to display scanned network information.
-   Flashlight: Turn On the Torch (AKA “flashlight”) if the device has a camera flash LED.
-   Auto-Rotation: Turn auto-rotation On or Off.
-   Factory Reset: Perform a factory reset of the device, regardless of the compliance policy applied.
-   Kiosk App Selection: Change the app that runs in kiosk mode. The device user can choose any installed app on the device to act as the kiosk app, with the Esper Console kept in sync on the configuration stats.
- Storage: Helps to grant permissions to any directories on the device. On devices running Android 10 or below, it is advised that the Console admins inform the users to grant permissions to the root folder. On Android 11 devices, permission cannot be granted to the root folders and download folder.
-   Esper Branding: Turn Off the Esper logo on the 'Home' screen.
-   About: Supplies information regarding the endpoint name the device is enrolled in, in case the customer has access to multiple Esper endpoints.
-   Mobile Data: Access mobile data on the device.
-   Clear App Data: Clears the data and cache for a particular application.
-   Display: Manage screen rotation, screen brightness and screen timeout.
-   Sound: Manage ringtone, alarm, device volume and the notification volume.
-   Reboot: Ability to reboot the device.
-   Keyboard: Navigate to Android settings on the Android 8.1 and lower devices to change the keyboard settings.
-   Accessibility: Navigate to Android settings on the Android 8.1 and lower devices to change the accessibility settings.
-   Input Selection: Navigate to Android settings on the Android 8.1 and lower devices to change the input selection for the device.
-   Bluetooth: Navigate to Android settings application on the Android 8.1 and lower devices to change the Bluetooth setting. 

The scan button on the bottom right will allow searching and show nearby devices. Click the **Connect** button to pair the device, and the connection will happen immediately.
You can connect only non-A2DP devices like headphones, mouse, and keyboards and can’t connect phones and laptops.
Note: Bluetooth Scan support requires location to be turned ON. 

:::tip
It is always advised to pair and use one device only. In case another device is required, delete and unpair the old device before connecting the new one.
:::

-   Language: Navigate to Android settings on the Android 8.1 and lower devices to change the language setting.
-   Date and Time: Navigate to Android settings on the Android 8.1 and lower devices to change the date and time for the device.

Users have the ability to add or remove settings in both modes.

![Modes](./images/createpolicy/9-userability.png)

Admin Mode is password protected to prevent unauthorized access. This password controls access to the hidden dock available in kiosk mode, the Esper Settings app, and serves as the PIN used for IMEI-based provisioning via AfW. The password is alphanumeric and can have 1 to 10 characters.

The default password is 1234. It is possible to set up a template without a password for these features, or just leave the default password; Esper strongly recommends setting up a more complex password for stronger security. The same password will be set for all devices provisioned using the template

:::tip
A hidden doc is available in both the kiosk mode and the multi-app mode. You can access it with 3-taps on the right corner in kiosk mode or 3-clicks on the power button in multi-app mode. 
:::

**Open Esper Settings or Wi-Fi settings directly-** You can now launch the Esper Setting or Wi-Fi settings directly from the third-party application. If the 3-tap or power button is not available, you can send intent to open the Esper settings or wifi menu now from your application. 

```java
fun launchEsperSettings() {
        val intent = Intent()
        intent.component = ComponentName("io.shoonya.shoonyadpc", "com.shoonyaos.shoonyasettings.activities.MainActivity")
        intent.flags = Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK
        startActivity(intent)
}
```

### Manage Android Settings Application via Policy

  

This setting will display the icon for the default Android settings application on the Home screen of the device. Clicking this icon will take the user to the default Android settings. Depending on the other configurations set by the Compliance Policy, some options may be disabled to the user. Just by switching On/Off via console users can control it on the device.

### Google Account Restriction via Policy

  

This setting enables you to restrict the number of Google accounts that can be added on the device and used with Google apps like Gmail, Google Play Store, and YouTube. By default, any number of accounts can be added to a specific device; this setting restricts this number. For example, if you set this setting to two, only two accounts will be permitted on the device, further addition (or deletion) of accounts will not be possible unless a different compliance policy is reapplied.

![Google account restrictions](./images/createpolicy/11-googlerestrictions.png)

:::tip
If you don’t check the Google account restrictions box and plan to provision your device in Multi-application mode, we recommend disabling Google Play Store to prevent the installation of unapproved applications.
:::

:::tip
The Google Account Restriction feature is applicable only to Google Mobile Services (GMS) Android devices. If you include the Android Settings App and wish to prevent any Google accounts from being added, set the Number of accounts to 0.
:::

### Protect Device from Hard/Soft Factory Reset via Policy

Factory Reset Protection (FRP) places an auto-lock on a GMS-certified device if a user factory resets it with soft or hard keys. FRP will auto-lock the device and keep it locked until a pre-authorized Google account ID is entered. Additional information about getting your Google Account ID can be found in the [here](./frp.md).

When you turn On the FRP button in the provisioning template, you’ll need to pick a Google account to authorize future device unlocks. Your chosen Google account ID will reverse any future auto-lock events triggered by user factory resets for all devices provisioned with this template.
