## How to use IMEI/Serial Number Onboarding Method?

Esper enables you to use IMEI and serial numbers to onboard your devices using the Android for Work (AFW) method. Only Android GMS devices running Android 6.0 or above support AFW. It works by using the AFW onboarding process to pass the available IMEIs and serial number for the device to Esper which is then matched to a Blueprint that includes either the device's IMEI or serial number. That Blueprint is then used to onboard the device. You need to prepare a Blueprint beforehad.


Step 1: Begin by [factory resetting](./factory-reset.md) your device.

Step 2: Once the factory reset is completed, on the first screen, click on the **START** button.

:::tip
The button title may be a variation of getting started, setting up your device, or let’s go.

Step 3: If your device does not have an active cellular data network connection, you will need to connect the device to the internet using cellular or Wi-Fi.

If you have a cellular device without a SIM, you may encounter the below screen first. Select **SKIP** if you plan to use Wi-Fi. Otherwise, proceed to insert your SIM with cellular data support.

Step 4: When presented with the ‘Copy apps & data’ screen, select ‘Set up as new’. This text may be ‘Don’t Copy’ or another variant.

:::tip
On some devices, this may appear after establishing a Wi-Fi connection.

It will take a few moments for the Google ‘Sign-in’ screen to appear.

Step 7: In the Email or phone field, enter **afw#esper** and then select **Next**. As a certified Google EMM partner, this is a particular keyword used by the AFW onboarding process that will then start the process to enroll your device into Esper.

The Esper Agent will now start the installation, and a series of screens will display as Esper prepares for the enrollment.

Step 11: The screen flow will stop on the Authentication screen. Enter the Passcode that you set up in the associated Blueprint. If you purposely did not set a passcode, leave the Passcode field blank. Once the device is ready, click or tap on **CONTINUE**.

**Notes**:

1.  If you wish to exit the onboarding process for any reason, Click on the **Esper** logo 6 times to bring up the option to factory reset the device.
    
2.  If your Blueprint enables Google Play, Google Play Services will be updated. Be aware that this is done by Google and depends on their current quality of service.

Typically (but not always), you need to resolve the permission and allow Esper to modify System settings. Click on **RESOLVE** to open up the Android System settings application to provide the consent.

Step 13: On the 'Can modify system settings’ screen and a list of Applications will be displayed.

:::tip
These are Applications that have been granted or are requesting permission to modify system settings. Esper Device Management will be set to 'No,' or 'Not Allowed.' Click on Esper Device Management to change this setting.

Step 16: You will now return to the Esper Agent. You will typically need to grant another permission to allow Esper to draw over other applications. This is done to ensure a smooth experience for Kiosk mode apps. Click on **RESOLVE** to open up the Android system settings application to provide the permission.

Step 17: On the 'Display Over Other Apps' or 'Draw Over Other Apps' screen, you will see a list of applications that have been granted or are requesting permission to display over other applications.

Now the onboarding is complete, and your device is set up according to your Blueprint. In this example, we’ve onboarded in multi-application mode with three Enterprise applications installed from the Esper Cloud and managed Google Play enabled.
