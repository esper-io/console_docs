# How to Install the ADB Tool 


Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is a command line tool that lets you communicate with a device, enabling you to access certain features of the Android platform that are not otherwise accessible. To set up a device with Esper Foundation for Android (EFA), you must send commands to the device â€” requiring you to install the ADB tool on your computer, be it Windows or macOS. Windows devices do not have ADB drivers installed. These drivers are required to detect the device when using the Esper Device Provisioner Tool on a Windows machine. Mac devices come with ADB drivers, but we recommend installing the tool.
