## What is Esper’s Seamless Provisioning Method?

This method of onboarding can only be used if you have chosen to get devices from Esper. Esper provides the option to recommend hardware devices baked with Esper optimized Android OS, known as Esper Enhanced Android. These devices are the easiest to onboard as all information for onboarding is already baked into the OS of the device. All you need to do is boot the device.

### On the Esper Console

You can create upload IMEI or Serial number while creating  a device record. 
    

If you need help, please refer to [create a device record](../devices-groups/device-record.md).

### On the Device

Ideally, you should see true zero-touch onboarding on your devices for which the IMEI or serial numbers was uploaded on the Blueprint. You should be able to boot the device and watch it onboard automatically by Esper according to your Blueprint. If you have known Wi-Fi in the deployment field, it can be baked in the Esper Enhanced Android OS. If the Wi-Fi SSID cannot be found an option to manually connect to Wi-Fi will appear. Connecting to a network/WiFi will then continue the onboarding process requiring no further input from the user.
