## How to use the Device Provisioner Tool for Onboarding?

For your ease, we have created a tool for onboarding which internally uses the ADB (Android Debugging Tool).

This method can be used to provision most Android devices regardless of whether they are -

-   GMS or Non-GMS
-   Have a camera or not
-   All Android versions including 4.x and 5.x
    
We have made the Device Provisioner user-friendly, and it takes you through a step-by-step process with minimum logs seen on the screen.

:::tip
User should have access to Esper endpoint, have the Blueprint created, the device physically available and connected to the computer via USB.
