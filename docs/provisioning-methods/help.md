You’ll need to provide the following information:

-   Android version — Check the Android version on your device by navigating to **Settings** > **About** > **Android Version**. Choose the correct version of Android for your device from the dropdown menu.
-   Esper Foundation — Esper Foundation for Android is a purpose-built Android OS optimized for deployment under the Esper system. Esper provides Esper Foundation devices on request. Click **YES**, if your devices are Esper Foundation.
-   GMS support — Click **YES** if your Android device supports Google Mobile Services.
    

:::tip
If the Play Store application is included on your device, your device will likely support GMS.
:::

-   Camera — Choose **YES**, if your device has a working camera.
    

Then click **Suggest Provisioning Method**.

Based on your selections, the tool will suggest one of the four provisioning methods by highlighting it. Click to see the steps to provision your device. If you still have trouble figuring the provisioning process, Esper’s support team ([support@esper.io](mailto:support@esper.io)) will be happy to assist you. Send an email to support@esper.io.

:::tip
If a device stalls during provisioning, there’s a way to exit out and factory reset it. On any provisioning screen showing the Esper logo, tap the logo seven times. This will bring up the Factory Reset button. Simply click the button to start the reset process.
